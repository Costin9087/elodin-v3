# Azure Content Understanding Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Azure Content Understanding Failed" errors with HTTP 500 responses and "InvalidImage" error codes from Azure's API.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Insufficient file validation** - The frontend was accepting any file with `image/*` MIME type, including formats not supported by Azure
2. **Missing file size validation** - No enforcement of the 10MB limit mentioned in the UI
3. **Poor error handling** - Generic error messages that didn't help users understand what went wrong
4. **No file corruption detection** - Files could be corrupted or have incorrect headers

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Validation (`UploadStep.tsx`)
- ✅ **Strict file type checking**: Now only accepts JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, TIFF (Azure's supported formats)
- ✅ **File size validation**: Enforces 10MB limit
- ✅ **Empty file detection**: Prevents upload of empty files
- ✅ **Updated file input accept attribute**: Now specifies exact MIME types instead of `image/*`
- ✅ **Updated UI text**: Shows correct supported formats

### 2. Backend Validation (`extract-text.ts`)
- ✅ **Server-side file type validation**: Double-checks file types on the backend
- ✅ **File size validation**: Server-side enforcement of size limits
- ✅ **File signature validation**: Checks actual file headers to detect corruption/mismatch
- ✅ **Buffer validation**: Ensures file can be properly read into memory
- ✅ **Debug logging**: Added hex dump of file headers for troubleshooting

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling (`azureContentUnderstanding.ts` & `App.tsx`)
- ✅ **Azure-specific error parsing**: Interprets Azure error codes (InvalidImage, InvalidRequest, etc.)
- ✅ **User-friendly error messages**: Provides clear guidance on what went wrong
- ✅ **Detailed logging**: Better error details for debugging
- ✅ **Fallback API attempts**: Tries multiple Azure API versions/endpoints

### 4. File Signature Validation
Added validation for file headers to detect:
- JPEG: `FF D8 FF`
- PNG: `89 50 4E 47 0D 0A 1A 0A`
- BMP: `42 4D`
- TIFF: `49 49 2A 00` or `4D 4D 00 2A`
- PDF: `25 50 44 46`

## Supported File Formats
- **JPEG** (.jpg, .jpeg)
- **PNG** (.png)
- **BMP** (.bmp)
- **TIFF** (.tiff, .tif)
- **PDF** (.pdf)

## File Size Limits
- Maximum: **10MB**
- Minimum: **> 0 bytes**

## Testing the Fix

### Test Cases to Verify
1. **Valid files**: Upload JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF, PDF files under 10MB
2. **Invalid formats**: Try uploading GIF, WebP, SVG (should be rejected)
3. **Large files**: Try uploading files over 10MB (should be rejected)
4. **Empty files**: Try uploading 0-byte files (should be rejected)
5. **Corrupted files**: Try uploading files with wrong extensions or corrupted headers
6. **File type mismatches**: Try uploading a file with wrong extension (e.g., .jpg file that's actually .png)

### Expected Behaviors
- ✅ Clear error messages for each rejection reason
- ✅ Files are validated both client-side and server-side
- ✅ Azure API receives only properly formatted files
- ✅ Better logging for debugging any remaining issues

### Deployment Notes
After deploying these changes:
1. Test with a variety of file types and sizes
2. Check Azure Function logs for any new errors
3. Verify that the validation messages are user-friendly
4. Monitor Azure Content Understanding API success rates

## Common Error Messages and Solutions

| Error Message | Cause | Solution |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| "Please select a supported file format: JPEG, PNG, BMP, PDF, or TIFF" | Unsupported file type | Use only supported formats |
| "File size must be less than 10MB" | File too large | Compress or resize the file |
| "File appears to be empty" | Zero-byte file | Select a valid file |
| "File signature does not match..." | Corrupted or mislabeled file | Re-save file in correct format |
| "Invalid image file: The file submitted couldn't be parsed" | Azure still rejecting file | File may be password-protected or corrupted |

## Monitoring
- Azure Function logs now include file header hex dumps for debugging
- Error responses include detailed validation information
- Frontend logs provide step-by-step upload process details
