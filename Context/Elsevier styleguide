Acronyms and abbreviations Our rules for writing acronyms: For well known acronyms like API, HTML and AI: use the acronym instead of spelling it out. For lesser known and specialist acronyms like APC (Article Publishing Charge), EIC (Editor in Chief), OA (open access) and SD (ScienceDirect): In the first use, spell the full name accompanied by the acronym in brackets – Article Publishing Charge (APC) – then use only the acronym in further uses. For Elsevier’s internal acronyms like STMJ, ASA and JHP: avoid using them unless they are part of a product offering or a feature name – then use them like a specialist acronym. An exception: If the acronym is an established product name like SSRN, you don’t need to spell it out unless you think it would help explain the product’s purpose within the context you’re writing about.  Active and passive voice Use the active voice whenever possible. When writing, we have the option to construct sentences using the active or the passive voice. The difference between the two is the relationship of the sentence’s subject to its verb. When a sentence is in the active voice, the subject is performing an action. In the passive voice, the action’s target is the focus of the sentence. Passive voice sentences often use more words and can be vague. Passive voice in research The passive voice is commonly used in academic writing, for a few purposes: To convey a sense of objectivity by avoiding the first person — Changes in the DNS were observed. To emphasise the thing being acted on — Reagent was added to the sample. When the person or thing carrying out the action is unknown or unclear — The molecules were agitated by an unknown agent. If you are quoting from a research paper, it’s okay to retain the passive voice. But for all other audience-focused copy and content, try to write in the active voice.  American or British English? Elsevier follows American spelling and punctuation conventions, but allows for British exceptions in countries that use British English. This means you should: use US English for global website content and global marketing materials. use British English for any established product conventions, such as using British date format. Whichever convention you use, consistency is the key. A few examples: You’ll find a range of more complete catalogues online, including . For writing dates, .  Ampersand (&) Use the ampersand when it is part of a journal’s formal name or an article title: Bioorganic & Medicinal Chemistry, The Lancet Diabetes & Endocrinology You can also use ampersands in place of and if space is tight, such as for website navigation on mobile screens. Other than these cases, do not use an ampersand except for common accepted abbreviations: R&D. But even for those, think carefully about how clear the abbreviation might be. To be on safe side, it’s better to say Research and Development.  Apostrophes (') The apostrophe is normally used to show possession or to replace omitted words (see  above). To show possession, use an apostrophe with an s after: singular nouns not ending in s: The journal’s editor plural nouns not ending in s: the alumni's contributions, women's rights Use an apostrophe with no s after: plural nouns ending in s: the journals' audiences, the editors' decisions nouns that are plural in form but singular in meaning: mathematics' rules, measles' effects Do not use an apostrophe with its to show possession: The journal has its own platform. (It’s means “it is” — see Contractions above.) You can find more guidance on apostrophes in the .  Bold text As with other copy styles, the point here is to help users quickly understand what we mean, and let them be confident that we are consistent. Use bold text to direct users to an element on the page such as a: CTA button text link heading or subheading form field checkbox, etc. See the examples below. Don’t use quotations marks, eg Use the “Upload” button. They are used in other ways (like for actual quotes) – and also, each quotation mark is one more element for the user’s eyes to read. Bold text is quicker to read and easier on their eyes: When not to use bold: Anywhere you want to emphasize copy just to make it stand out. By keeping to the rule above, we will avoid confusing users with mixed uses of bold.  Bullet and number lists Bulleted and numbered lists have several benefits for users: Lists are scannable. They group key points together. Numbered lists give users a logical sequence of information or actions. A list should always have a brief sentence to introduce it. This can be: a complete sentence ending with a colon or question mark (Tips for using CiteScore metrics:; What are your open access options?). a stem sentence (a partial sentence) ending with a colon, to be completed by each list item (Options for open access include:). Punctuating and capitalizing list items If your introduction to a list is a stem (incomplete) sentence and each list item completes the sentence, begin each item with lower case and end it with a period: But if your intro is a stem sentence and each list item is very short, do not add a period after each item: Where possible, begin your list items in a consistent way (e.g., all verbs or all nouns), and write your stem sentence to include as many intro words as possible: If your intro is a complete sentence, add a period to list items that are also complete sentences. If your items are not complete sentences, don’t give them periods: Avoid mixing complete and incomplete sentences in your list: Bullets or numbers? Number your list if the order is important, like with the steps of a process. Don’t use numbers when the order of the items doesn’t matter.  Capitalization (title case vs sentence case) With title case, nearly every word in a sentence, heading or label is capitalized. With sentence case, only the first word is capitalized. Title case is more common in the US than elsewhere, but readability studies have shown that users read sentence case more quickly. The non-US convention is sentence case. See the examples below. Use title case for: published work — journal titles, book titles, song titles, works of art. organization names. people’s names. Submissions product and service names. How to use title case: Capitalize all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs and adjectives within the name. Use lower case for articles (a, an, the), prepositions (to, on, for etc) and conjunctions (but, and, or etc), unless they are the first word in the sentence: Use sentence case for everything else: How to use sentence case: Capitalize only the first character of the first word: Use title case for our products and services Use title case for our products and services, whatever the UI, channel or touchpoint. This ensures users will read it clearly in all uses, including in the body copy of web pages and emails:  Colons (:) and semicolons (;) Use a colon to introduce a subclause which follows logically from the text before it and is not a new concept. Do not use a colon if the two parts of the sentence are not logically connected: Use a semicolon if you have two sentences that are about the same topic. Maybe either could stand alone as grammatically correct, but a semicolon lets you bring them together as a single sentence covering two related parts: Use just one space after a colon or semicolon.  Commas (,) Elsevier style does not use serial commas (also called the Oxford comma) — commas after every element in a list including the item before the and. So in general, don’t use a comma before the and. The exception to this rule is when it's unclear if the last two nouns in the sentence are part of a group. In this case, use a comma for clarity:  Compound modifiers When you use two words directly before a noun to describe that noun, those two words are called compound modifiers. They are modifying the noun and are usually (but not always) connected by a hyphen: He was wearing a silly-looking hat. (Silly-looking is modifying the noun hat.) She is his long-standing friend. (Whereas a long standing friend just needs to sit down.) The article was published in a lesser-known journal. In those examples, the two hyphened words essentially become the adjective for the noun — they are describing it. You can even have a three-word modifier: She lives in a burning-bright-yellow house. The design uses drag-and-drop list items. Exceptions to the hyphen rule  has examples of when not to hyphenate a compound modifier: ice cream sundae, video game sales, breast cancer cases, health care laws, child care workers and fourth grade teacher. Also, if you use the modifying words after the noun, you normally should not use the hyphen: The hat he was wearing seemed silly looking. Within the life sciences field, the journal was lesser known. Remember, if it helps make the sentence clearer, include the hyphen in the modifier: . : em dash, en dash and hyphens.  Contractions Contractions mash together two words to make them shorter. I am becomes I’m. We are becomes we’re. They have becomes they’ve. Our audience covers a wide range of users who aren’t native English speakers and who might not understand all contractions. So avoid most contractions except for the following commonly-used contractions, which may be used to convey a more informal tone: it’s for it is can’t for cannot don’t for do not you’ll for you will (You will can sometimes sound like a demand.) Note: can’t and don’t are friendlier and more informal than cannot and do not. But if you need to convey a critical step, use cannot and do not.  Dangling modifiers Dangling modifiers (also called dangling participles) are common writing mistakes. They occur when a word or phrase meant to modify or describe another word or phrase is out of place. The results can be funny, as the examples below show. Remember to follow the comma with the subject that the modifier is talking about:  Dashes and hyphens Em dashes (—), en dashes (–) and hyphens ( - ) are valuable tools to use in your writing, giving you more ways to give clarity to your words and sentences. Em and en dashes got their names from the letters they look like: an em dash is roughly the width of the letter M, and an en dash the width of the letter N. Use an em dash: to separate extra information in a sentence, with a space before and after the dash: Whichever publishing payment option you choose — subscription and open access — the submission and peer review process will be the same. In this use, the em dash serves the same purpose as parentheses or commas. to mark a break in a sentence: Be sure you understand what ethics in publishing covers — plagiarism, competing interests, use of generative AI and more. In this use, the em dash replaces a colon or semicolon. Keyboard shortcuts for the em dash: Mac: Shift + Option + Hyphen (-) Windows: Alt + 051 Use an en dash: to show a range of dates or numbers, with no space before or after the dash: Omicron, the first variant of covid, was the primary strain March–November 2020; The article appeared in pages 24–85 of the April publication; The convention will be held March 15–21. to replace the word to in location-based phrases: The Berlin–Singapore flight takes 10 hours. Keyboard shortcuts for the en dash: Mac: Option + Hyphen (-) Windows: Alt + 050 Use a hyphen: as a joiner of multiple or compound words, with no spaces before or after the hyphen: pre-submission; absorption-based post-combustion carbons; deep-fried Mars bar. to join adjectives and other noun modifiers: twice-yearly publication; frequently-cited article. Use of the hyphen…can be a matter of taste, judgment and style sense. Think of hyphens as an aid to readers’ comprehension. If a hyphen makes the meaning clearer, use it. If it just adds clutter and distraction to the sentence, don’t use it. — AP Stylebook Further reading:   Dates Elsevier products and platforms use both American (November 8, 2023) and British (8 November, 2023) formats, depending on the product. For example, ScienceDirect and Scopus use British format while  and  use American. Our guidance is to stay consistent with the product you’re writing for. Check which format is the standard. Guidance for both American and British formats: Capitalize the names of months in all uses. Spell the month wherever you can, to make it clear to the user. If you display 4/7/2023, it’s not clear if you mean April 7 or July 4: When a phrase lists only a month and a year, do not separate the year with commas: When you refer to a month and day within the current year, do not include the year: Use an s without an apostrophe to indicate spans of decades or centuries: It’s okay to use a year to start a sentence: 2013 was a very good year. Common differences between British and American dates:  Italics Use italics for journal titles within body copy: But if you’re presenting a list of journal titles, do not italicize the titles: Do not italicize institution names:   Measurements Spell out the following: inches (exception: you may use inch marks instead: 24") feet (exception: you may use a single inch mark instead: 10') miles pounds (as in weight) yards Use the following abbreviations: cm (centimeter) dpi (dots per inch) GB (gigabyte) KB (kilobyte) mm (millimeter) mph (miles per hour) Hz (hertz) MB (megabyte) Back to top Numbers Numbers lower than 10 are spelled out in running copy (e.g., We publish six issues per year) except in headlines, social media or fields when number count is a concern. Exceptions: ages currencies percentages dates (for most uses. See the ) times Numbers 10 and above should not be spelled out (e.g., The first article appeared 12 years ago). Exceptions: At the start of a sentence (e.g., Twenty-six years ago the journal changed its format). H4 Other rules for writing numbers Use commas to separate thousands (e.g., 1,000). Use periods within decimals (e.g., 3.62, 78.55). Use commas to separate thousands (e.g., 1,000). Write out the words "million" or "billion" in text. Use lowercase letters at the start of the words, i.e., million not Million. Do not use "K" for thousand except for style in a headline or in a table where you want to save space. Use the full number, e.g., 94,600 not 94.6K. Be consistent with treatment within tables or headlines. In those cases, use the uppercase form of the letter: K, M or B. Do not use a space between the number and the letter, i.e., 18M. To indicate "more" with a number, add a plus sign at the end. Do not include a space between the number and the plus sign, e.g., 18M+. Use the greater than ">" only in mathematical comparisons between two numbers or as a "more than" sign for percentages in headers, e.g., >80%. When it's assumed the numbers are rounded, it's preferable to omit the symbols (+ and >). (You can be more specific in the actual text, e.g., More than 80 percent of subscribers said they planned to renew.  Percentages Use the % sign when you are pairing with a number, with no space: When you’re writing about a percentage as points, spell out the word: For amounts less than 1%, precede the decimal with a zero: In informal cases, use words rather than numbers and %:  Periods (also called full stops) Use periods at the end of a sentence, followed by just one space. Do not use periods at the end of: headings and subheadings bullet list items unless the list items are complete sentences. (See  above.) form field labels and short instructional text. (See forms guidance in Writing for UI elements  Quotation marks (“) Use open-quote marks and close-quote marks to surround the exact words from a speaker or writer: “Since 1959, there have been various revolutionary developments in the field of nanotechnology.” When using a quoted sentence on its own, without referencing the source of the quote, put the final punctuation mark (period, question mark or exclamation mark) inside the close-quote mark: “Nanotechnology has produced materials of various types at nanoscale level.” “What are the fundamental traits of nanotechnology?” “There are few fields as exciting right now as nanotechnology!” When referencing the source: Before the quote, write the source’s name and “said” followed by a comma, then the quote: Samantha said, “I have no interest in nanotechnology.” After the quote, use a comma before the close-quote mark, then the source’s name: “Nanotechnology bores me,” Samantha said. Inside a quote, use a comma before a close-quote mark, then the source’s name, “said” and a comma, then an open-quote mark and the rest of the quote: “If you forced me to learn nanotechnology,” she said, “it would make me leave you forever.” H4 When to use single quotation marks (') Our style is to use double quotation marks for all quotes from a speaker or written text. If the quote you're using references another quote, use single quotation marks inside the quote you’re using: “I was discussing nanotechnology with Samantha and she said, ‘I have zero interest in it’, so I stopped trying to convince her.”  Quotes and testimonials Quotations from people add weight and legitimacy to your design. They can be words from a product user, a subject matter expert, an interview, a publication or any other verifiable source. How to format a quote: Ideally, indent the quote as a block. The standard HTML element is . Put the quotation inside double quotation marks. Put the person’s name below the quotation, beginning with an em dash then a single space. Add any contextual information (job title, publication, setting, country, etc) after the person’s name, separated by a comma. Examples: “Their kung pao chicken was the best meal I’ve had in five years.” — Esmerelda Davenport, Peterborough   “I found the new submissions process very straightforward and smooth. The instructions were all clear and valuable." — Paul Shnoogleman, University of Scuthorpe  Prepositions of place and time (at / in / on) Prepositions are words used to connect nouns, pronouns and phrases with other words, to show direction, location and time: I will drive over the bridge. Then I will swim across the English Channel. I’ve been eating chocolate mousse since 1995. I will continue eating it until I explode. Three prepositions used to describe time and place – at, in and on – are the most commonly used and often the most confusing. The rules for each: At Use at with clock times and mealtimes: You can also use at when you’re talking about the weekend and night: Use at with Christmas and other holidays: In Use in with parts of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) and longer periods of time such as months, seasons and years: You can also use in with abstract time references such as the past and future: On Use on with days and dates: We also use on when talking about websites, products and devices:  References Recommended format as follows: Uzuner, S, et al: Title with hyperlink, Journal of English for Academic Purposes (Month and Year) If no hyperlink is available: Authors or Lead Author et al: "Title of paper," Journal Name in Ital, Vol 7, No. 4, pp. 250-263 (Month and Year) Interdisciplinary / transdisciplinary (see also Transdisciplinary) – when referring to more than one branch of knowledge Multidisciplinary – when referring to a combination of several academic disciplines or professional specializations in an approach to a topic or problem Transdisciplinary / interdisciplinary (see also Interdisciplinary) – when referring to more than one branch of knowledge Split infinitives An infinitive (sometimes called a full infinitive) is a basic form of a verb, usually following “to”: The university chose to fund the research. Editor decided to accept the manuscript for publication. A split infinitive occurs when another word, such as an adverb or adjective, separates to from the verb: The university chose to retroactively fund the research. Editor decided to immediately accept the manuscript for publication. When you consider using a split infinitive, ask yourself (or a colleague) if it makes the sentence less or more clear. In this example, it makes it more clear:  Symbols Basic mathematical symbols such as > (greater than), < (less than), = (equal to), + (plus) and others can save time and space for the writer, but they generally reduce clarity for the reader. Consider these two sentence versions: Last month the number of submissions was > the number for February. Last month the number of submissions was greater than the number for February. For most readers, the second version is clearer. So the general rule is to avoid using mathematical symbols. Instead, write out the meaning in words.  Times Use numbers except for noon and midnight. Use the 12-hour and not the 24-hour clock (10 a.m. and 3 p.m., not 10:00 and 15:00). Use a colon to separate hours from minutes (9:45 a.m., 3:30 p.m.). To show the time range in a day, you can use a hyphen (9-11 a.m.) or use to (the meeting will be 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.). Avoid redundancies such as 10 a.m. this morning, 10 p.m. tonight or 10 p.m. Monday night.  Verbing Verbing (also called nominalization) is when we use nouns as verbs: The team dialogued solutions; Let’s table that idea; I will pencil in a meeting. Nouns and verbs are the fundamental building blocks of any language. A noun is a thing and a verb is an action. If you only use these two, you have a complete sentence (and a small story). An author writes. Oranges grow. Dogs chew. Dog owners fret. Every other word form supports this basic structure. Adjectives describe nouns and adverbs describe verbs. The motivated author writes precisely. Pronouns, prepositions and particles all help glue our noun and verb phrases together to give them meaning. But we writers and speakers of languages sometimes don’t stay true to our nouns and verbs. Sometimes, in the name of Powerpoint slides, lack of time or just language innovation, we to turn a noun into a verb: The team was dialoguing solutions. Some verbing has become accepted and standard. Larry measured his doorway. Priti researched the audience. The team experimented with genAI. But verbing can quickly get out of control, especially in organizations. We need to operationalize this model. Can we caucus this idea together? Let’s roadmap this thing. The cost to the user of verbing is clarity. Try to avoid it. Think about what you want your sentences to say, and use nouns in their original form when you can.  ---  ## Writing for a Digital Product  Writing for a product Intro Writing for a product needs a strategic approach to deliver content that is consistent and useful throughout the user journey. Types of content your audience can come across on their product journey includes: Marketing content about the product: Created by the marketing team, including promotional materials and release notes. Technical documentation: Developed by technical writers, covering detailed product information. User Interface (UI) copy: Written by the UX team, focusing on copy and features in the product and navigation. In-Product Messaging: Managed by the product team, providing guidance and updates directly within the product. General best practices for product writing Consistency is key When users interact with Elsevier products, they often move from one tool to another to accomplish their tasks. Understanding their journey and the context of their roles, and maintaining consistency across platforms and products helps create a seamless experience. Use a consistent tone of voice that reflects . Whether you’re writing for ScienceDirect, Reaxys, or ClinicalKey, the tone should be professional, clear, and supportive. Use the same terminology in the same context. For example, if you refer to “articles” in ScienceDirect, use the same term across the different pages of that product. Aligning on terminology with other products can also benefit the user, but keep in mind there are many reasons for using different terminology in other products of which you might not be aware. Similar actions should have the same interactions. For example, if clicking a Save button in ScienceDirect adds an article to a library, the same action in Mendeley should have a similar effect. Short, clear, concise Users need to quickly grasp the value and functionality of the product, often within limited space. Some best practices are: Be brief: Use short sentences and paragraphs to make your content easy to read. For example, instead of saying “The product has a variety of features that can be utilized in numerous ways,” say “The product offers multiple features for various uses.” Write for clarity: Avoid jargon and complex language. Keep your message straightforward and understandable. For instance, replace “utilize” with “use” and “functionality” with “features.” Stick to the essential information: Cut out any unnecessary words or details. Instead of “In order to ensure the best possible experience, we recommend that you follow these steps,” say “Follow these steps for the best experience.” See also:  Benefits over features When writing about a product, the focus should be on how it benefits the user rather than just listing its features. This user-centric approach helps create a stronger connection with your audience and makes your content more compelling. Here’s how to do it: Focus on benefits: Highlight how the product improves the user’s life. Explain the value and advantages the product offers, such as saving time and reducing effort. User-centric language: Use language that resonates with the user’s needs and desires. Show how the product solves their problems or improves their experience.   Writing UI copy  When you write copy for a product’s UI (user interface) such as a button, form field label or tooltip, you are writing microcopy. As the name suggests, microcopy is short, usually required to fill a small amount of space. And like any other UX copy, its number one priority is clarity. If the user does not quickly understand it, the product’s experience can fail and they could leave. So as a writer, you need to know the context of the copy: where it's located on the page, how it fits in the user journey, what research has been done on it, what the intended purpose is, and most importantly, who the audience is, how they're accessing your content, and what their needs are. Writing specific UI elements Alt text Alt text (alternative text) is a brief description of an image or other visual content. It helps people who are blind or have low vision understand what's in the image (through assistive technology such as screen readers), but it also helps every user’s experience — and even helps with SEO. .  Accordions An accordion component is a dynamic and interactive UI element designed to streamline the presentation of lengthy content within a limited screen space. It consists of a collapsible panel with a clickable header and content area. So users can selectively expand or collapse accordions, revealing or hiding their content. Best practice Carefully consider whether to use accordions. When you use them, you are hiding content from the user. If you need to read all of your content, it’s better to have it all displayed and not hidden. Write short, concise headings. Wrap each accordion title in a proper heading (h1-h6) that fits within the heading hierarchy of the page.  (Hubspot)  Alerts and notifications An alert is an element that displays a brief, important and immediate message in the flow of their task. Examples: Remember to upload your table files; Your order is in progress — this might take a minute; You should only select this option if you want to publish open access. A notification is a more general message informing a user about something but which may not require their immediate action. Examples: You’ve been invited to review a manuscript; Your password has been reset; Based on the information you’ve provided, your publishing options are below. Error messages are a type of alert but within the focus of a specific task like completing a form field or attempting a login. You’ll find our . Best practice Be clear and specific. Keep it short without being vague. Use the tone of voice of the page or product. Consider the context: what task is the user trying to do and what is their need? Give them information that will help them progress. You don’t need to finish the text with a period.  (Faqprime)  Badges Badges are small containers with numerical or text values placed adjacent to a UI element. Badges are meant to attract attention or signal a change, and are usually temporary. There are two types of badges: Counters are numerical badges indicating a running tally or count of a specific type of content (e.g., notifications, filter results) Flags are text badges indicating a system status (e.g., New or Done). Best practice Write labels that are concise and have meaning to the user. Include no more than three badges in the same location — If you need more than three, think about alternative options, such as tooltips or banners. Examples   Breadcrumbs A breadcrumb shows the user’s navigation path or trail (e.g., “Home > Products > Electronics”). Including a breadcrumbs is a design decision, but as a writer you can ask that the page labels are short, even if the page titles are long. Best practice Each page link is short and clearly reflects the location it links to. The trail starts with the highest level parent pages on the left and moves down to child pages. Do not list current page in the breadcrumb trail. Use an ellipsis (…) for long paths.  Buttons Button copy can have a variety of purposes, helping users enter a product or system, start or complete a task, move to a next step and more. The user needs to perform an action. The button and its label — also called the CTA (call to action) — enable that action. Best practice Use short labels. Use active verbs. The user needs to perform an action, so the button text should start with that action as a verb. Use words that explain what happens next. Make sure your words are clear. Use sentence case and no ending punctuation. You can use an ampersand (&). Use Sign in and not Login.  Checkboxes A checkbox allows users to select or deselect an option by clicking on it. Best practice Use sentence case for checkboxes. Do not use ending punctuation. Avoid long labels. Don't repeat words unnecessarily at the beginning of checkbox labels. Repetition makes it harder to scan the text and see their different options. Use positive phrasing — so that users are selecting for something to happen (opt-in) rather than selecting for something not to happen (opt-out). Exception: You can use Do not show this (item) again wizard welcome pages, dialog boxes, and messages.  (Autumn Kotsuiba on Medium)  (UX Stack Exchange)  Dropdown menus Dropdowns can be useful or they can create poor usability — see “Related” below. General rules on copy introducing a dropdown (not drop down or drop-down) menu or list: Avoid using the word dropdown as a noun or adjective in your prompt line. Make it clear what the dropdown will allow them to do. Related:  (Baymard)  Error messages When you write an error message, keep these points in mind: Users, especially new ones, may be confused or cautious about a process. Most users are not software engineers, so they won’t understand technical explanations. An error is an inherently negative situation. A user has tried to use part of your product, unsuccessfully. Many users' first thoughts will be that they did something wrong to create the error. Note: Form field errors are not as consequential as bigger actions like uploading files or saving and continuing. But field error messages, like all error messages, need to be clear, respectful and action-oriented. See our . Best practice 1. Don’t blame the user. Be respectful and reassuring. This includes avoiding technical language that a product team might not think is accusing the user, but which the user could perceive as blame: 2. Use clear and simple language. As with any other user-facing copy, write for clarity first.  as well as . If you have to use a technical term (like extraction), consider adding a short explanation. 3. Be precise and describe exact problems. Instead of writing something vague like A problem occurred, give users a more useful explanation. 4. Provide actions or solutions. Whenever possible, give the user a next step – even if the next step is waiting for an issue to be fixed. Here is a simple structure to use that captures these points: Description: What happened? Reason: Why did it happen? (This is optional – only include if your product can definitely tell the user why, and only if it helps explain what to do next.) Resolution: How can it be resolved? Examples Further reading Post on Medium: .  (an open source styleguide and design system).  from Nielsen Norman Group.  Form fields Most people don't enjoy completing a form. They see them as a necessary annoyance required for completing a task. So the more clarity you can bring to field labels and error messages, the better the experience will be for your users. Open  A form field has four elements: The label A concise (1-3 words) description of what a user needs to provide. Avoid verbs like “enter,” “add” or “input” if you can. (See “Placeholder” below to add clarity if needed.) Use sentence case, not title case. Don’t use punctuation (no colons or periods). Consider a global audience. Naming conventions and address formats differ from country to country, and for RTL (right-to-left) languages, the layout of the field label is mirrored. (Visit our .) Description (also called “helper text” or “hint”) Tells the user why the information is needed. Provides instructions such as character limits on what they can input. It should always be visible and displayed above the input field, below the label. Placeholder Use this only if it’s not clear how to interract with the field, ie for type-ahead fields (in which a list appears once they start typing) or a dropdown menu. If the field is just a straight text input, avoid a placeholder. Feedback message Normally used to provide an error message, for example the wrong format for a date or phone number. (Also called an “inline validation message”). A feedback message displays below the field, which changes to a red border for an error. . Form field error messages Unlike the requirements for writing page-level or product-level error messages as explained above, form field errors are more narrowly focused – a specific piece of information needs to be entered, in a specific format – which should make writing a field’s error message more straightforward. (Also see our .) “The goal is NOT to let the person know there was an error or … that the password is invalid. The goal is always for the person to achieve what they wanted by completing the form.” Mariano Hurtado Best practice: When writing a form field error message, keep in mind that it should go directly below the field, not above or inside it. It’s more accessible – screen readers will read out the error immediately after entering their information in the field. Keep the message short and succinct. Use clear language – avoid technical terms or acronyms if you can. Reference the same words as the field label and placeholder text (if there is any).  (Text) Links Clear and understandable text links are vital for users with disabilities (visual, cognitive and others) and for all users. A badly written text link can derail a user journey. A good text link explains its destination (the specific information, page or website it takes the user to) or purpose (to download, launch or other). Unlike buttons or badges, a link can’t convey meaning through form, color or icon — only through the words it contains. So choose your words carefully. Best practices Make the link text meaningful — tell the user where it will take them. Users should not have to guess where a link goes. Don’t say things like Click here or Click for more information or Read this. Write the sentence as you normally would, and link the relevant keywords. (The exception to this is when you’re linking to long journal, article or page titles – see below.) Don’t include preceding articles (a, an, the, our) in the linked text. Avoid including a full URL in copy. Most URLs don’t clearly say where they’re taking the user. It’s much more descriptive (and usually shorter) to use a clear and meaningful text link with the URL embedded within it. If a link comes at the end of a sentence or before a comma, don’t link the punctuation mark: Try to avoid long text links. If you're linking to a long article title, write the title followed by the text link Read the full article. Most URLs don’t clearly say where they’re taking the user. It’s much more descriptive (and usually shorter) to use a clear and meaningful text link with the URL embedded within it.  (Bullet and number) Lists Our grammar, punctuation and conventions page has a .  Navigation Navigation labels — in the top nav bar, side nav, tabs or breadcrumbs — tell a user what they can find on a site, app or page, and how they can see something specific. Clear and concise nav labels also help users scan. Best practices Make nav labels short. Use clear and simple words. Make your labels meaningful, using words people will be looking for. If a navigation label is the name of a task, website section or feature, use . If the nav label is the name of a product or service, .  Table of contents (jump menu) A web page’s table of contents (ToC) menu – sometimes called a jump menu – is an ordered list of links mapping to the sections on the page. There are right and wrong ways to use them. Many web pages are festivals of links – to product features, related pages, other sites and more. When users arrive at your page and see a stack of links, don’t force them to guess what they are for. Tell them the links are to the sections of your page (see Rules for creating… below). ToCs typically display at the top of the page under the page title, but they can sit in a side column instead. They can also be designed to be sticky – for a long page like a Guide for authors, a sticky ToC is helpful. Benefits of ToCs: For medium-to-long pages, a table of contents gives users a quick, scannable look at what’s on the page. They give users fast access to a specific topic or section. If your page is a long scroller, a ToC can increase the chances of users reading your lower-page content. Users can share a specific section using a URL fragment identifier (e.g.  ), if one is available. Rules for writing a table of contents Focus on your headings – most ToCs are simply a list of the headings on the page, automatically created by a site’s CMS.  is an example. So best practice says to write your headings and subheadings to be clear, concise and descriptive. Avoid the vague: Decide whether your ToC should display section headings, subheadings or both. Does your page have a small number of sections but many subsections within them, like ? Then it makes sense to display both levels. But if your page has many sections, it makes sense to only display their headings. Give your ToC its own heading – as an H2 under your page title – that explains its purpose: On this page is clear and obvious. Headings like Menu or Contents are less clear. Menu of what? Contents of what? Want to know more? Nielsen Norman has a helpful .  Tags Words or groups of words temporarily attached to an item. They serve as descriptive labels and help categorize or organize content. For example, in a blog, tags might be used to label posts with relevant topics (e.g., “technology,” “travel,” “food”). Best practices Write a tag that is succinct (e.g., “Featured,” “Important”). Use the same tag consistently for the same thing throughout the user journey.  Textareas Textareas are multi-line input fields where users can enter and edit text. They are commonly used for forms, comments and other areas where longer text input is required. Best practices Include context or instructions (e.g., “Leave a comment”) with your label. Clearly state limits in character count or other limitations.  Toggle labels Since toggles are digital on/off switches, their labels need to be very clear with no chance of being misunderstood. General rules: Make your labels short and direct. Make labels clear, using simple words. Write labels that convey a clear on/off choice:  Tooltips Our top tip: Think before creating tooltips. If you have to include a tooltip, be sure to: add value for the user. If you have nothing valuable to say, don’t add a tooltip. keep it short, from 1-2 sentences — lengthy content is not a tip. If you have more to say, add a Learn more link to a help article. get right to the point (as with other UX writing). use an active voice, starting with a verb. avoid stating the obvious.  Design terms for writers Design System – A set of on-brand design patterns, best practices, components and rules that guide a design team’s approach to creating products and websites. Graphene, Leyden and Next Generation are Elsevier's main design systems. Components – The building blocks of a design system. They can be small (e.g., buttons, icons) or large (e.g., navigation systems, carousels). They are designed to be simple yet flexible for reuse. Composite components – Reusable building blocks composed of smaller components. Pattern – Reusable template for common design solutions such as navigation menus, cards and forms. UI – the user interface, a combination of visual and interactive elements that allow users to interact with software applications, websites, or digital devices. UI is everything users see on their screens, including buttons, menus, forms, icons and layout design. Microcopy best practices Always use sentence case. Only punctuate sentences. Labels, headers, CTAs and other forms of microcopy do not need periods at the end. In case of space restraint you’re allowed to use an ampersand (&), otherwise ‘and’ is the preference.   Writing technical documentation  Technical documentation refers to any written material that explains how a product or system works, how to use it, and how to troubleshoot it. It helps users understand and effectively interact with a product. Some common types of technical documentation for Elsevier are: Frequently asked questions (FAQs) API documentation Troubleshooting guides Release notes Product training guides Best practices for writing technical documents Write with the audience in mind Determine who will be using the documentation. Are they beginners, intermediate users, or experts? Use appropriate language. Avoid jargon and technical terms that your audience may not understand. Use simple, clear language. Also view our . Provide context. Explain why certain steps or features are important. This helps users understand the relevance and how to apply the information. Include examples. Use real-world examples to illustrate complex concepts. This makes the content more relatable and easier to understand. Start with actual user questions Gather user feedback. Collect questions and feedback from users through surveys, support tickets, and forums. Prioritize common issues or questions. Organize your documentation in a Q&A format or include an FAQ section. Make sure all questions are answered, with step-by-step instructions if necessary. If possible, start your answers to yes/no questions with a Yes or No. Keep the documentation up-to-date Stay informed about updates, new features, and bug fixes in your product. Set a schedule for periodic reviews and updates of the documentation. Use feedback from users to identify areas that need updating or clarification. Maintain version control to track changes. Allow your users to provide feedback Encouraging user feedback helps improve the quality and usability of your documentation.  ---  ## Writing for Inclusion, Accessibility, Readability  Writing for everyone: Inclusion, accessibility, readability  Inclusion  Inclusive language is a broad term to describe: Language that acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Source: Linguistic Society of America What is considered inclusive language is constantly changing as our society evolves. Also, what would work for one person in a certain context might not work for another person. Please do your research, listen to your audience and test your copy. Benefits from a business perspective Using inclusive language from a business perspective will: promote trust: Using respectful language fosters a welcoming environment for people from diverse backgrounds, including various races, genders, sexual orientations, and abilities. mitigate legal and ethical risks: Non-inclusive language can lead to legal issues in workplaces, such as discrimination lawsuits, which can harm a company's reputation. enhance business value: Companies that prioritize diversity and inclusion often see greater innovation, improved financial performance and better user experiences. Best practice for inclusive writing Ask about preferences Ask people about their preferences. Person-first vs. Identity-first language: Person-first language emphasizes the person before their condition, which can reduce stigma and encourage seeking treatment. Examples: “person with a substance disorder,” “person with a vision impairment,” “person with autism,” “he has diabetes,” “she has a learning delay.” Identity-first language places the identity first, such as “Deaf person” or “autistic person.” Many in the Deaf and autism communities prefer this approach as they view their identities as integral to who they are. Other examples: “blind person,” “addict.” Pronouns: Always ask persons for their preferred pronouns to respect their gender identity. Examples: she/her, they/them, he/him, she/they. Cultural Identity: Ask how people prefer to be identified in terms of their cultural or ethnic background. Describe people in a neutral, relevant and precise way See also: . Only include descriptions of persons if necessary for context. Keep your descriptions factual and without generalizing race or ethnicity. Limit the use of adjectives. Include visuals if needed. Choose your words carefully Be mindful of the historical or geographical context your words can have. This is especially important when writing for a global audience. Check your biases and assumptions Communicate from a place of equality and empathy. What might be easy for you could be hard for someone else. Subscription prices or items on sale might be affordable for you, but expensive for someone else. Avoid cliches and idioms Cliches and idioms might not be relatable or understandable for everyone and usually don’t translate well. They are phrases that cannot be understood simply by looking at the meaning of the individual words in the phrase. Instead, write the literal meaning of what you’re trying to say   Accessibility Where  focuses on the complexity of the text, accessibility is about how we can make a text or site easier to access and understand for people with disabilities. Best practice Simplify complex information If information gets too complex, either simplify it on the page or provide a link to a separate, simplified version. See also:  Write unique, clear and informative page titles Provide a unique title for each page, describing the content on the page. Include the most important and unique information first. For instance, the page description before the company name. In a multi-step process, add the step to the title. Write headings that convey meaning and structure Good headings will create an outline of a text, and make the content scannable. Screen readers use the headings to navigate through the text, so indicate hierarchy with a consistent use of heading styles (e.g., H1 for the page title and H2 for the subheadings). Heading text needs to be as unique, clear and informative as page titles. Link text that’s meaningful Never use Click here. Instead, tell the user where the link will take them and add information about the link target (e.g., file size or format, document type, ‘opens in a new tab’). Keep it short. Alt text for images Alt text (alternative text) is a brief description of an image or other visual content. It helps people who are blind or have low vision understand what's in the image (through assistive technology such as screen readers), but it also helps every user’s experience — and even helps with SEO. Within the HTML of a page, an image’s alt text is the part in bold here: <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket."> Best practice Use the alt text to describe clearly and succinctly what is in the image. Don’t use the file name. Front-load it with the most important words. Use someone’s name in the alt text only if it’s relevant, ie alt="Elsevier CEO Kumsal Bayazit." End with a period (full stop). For decorative images that don’t contain information relevant to the page, use blank alt text: alt="" . Captions and transcripts for multimedia Captions and transcripts are essential for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, helping them understand the speech and non-speech (music, natural sounds, traffic etc) of any audio content, including as part of video. They are also helpful for anyone viewing your content in a noisy environment like a crowded cafe. Captions (also called closed captions) are a text version of the audio, synchronized with the audio and usually shown in a media player when users turn them on. They are sometimes called “subtitles” but they’re not the same: subtitles are for spoken audio translated into the user’s native language, and are not considered an accessibility tool. (Visit our .) Transcripts (also called transcriptions) are text versions of the full audio of multimedia content, whether it’s audio-only, such as a podcast, or part of a video. Best practice for captions and transcripts: Most modern media players provide automatic captioning. There are also some . When using computer-generated captions and transcripts, you should always check the quality of your content’s captions — before it goes live if possible, and edit them for accuracy. Mistakes can still happen and can be funny or embarrassing. Guidelines, tutorials and examples .  Readibility Readability refers to how easy it is to read and understand a text. Writing text that is easy to follow and understand will help all users. Some scenarios to consider: Time pressure: Simply written content is easier to scan and quicker to take in. Multi-tasking: With divided attention, you need simple information. Cognitive impairments: Simple language takes less cognitive load. Non-native speakers: They have less extensive vocabulary. Autism: National Autistic Society advises against the use of jargon. Measure your readability The readability score is determined using formulas that assess factors such as word complexity, sentence structure and other relevant data. These calculations help gauge the overall readability level of a piece of writing. Three methods used often are the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, the Gunning-Fog Index and SMOG (simple measure of gobbledigook). For Elsevier writing, which often involves academic and scientific content, the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a good choice to make your content accessible to a broader audience, including students and general readers. If your content is more specialized, the Gunning Fog Index might be more appropriate to improve clarity without oversimplifying complex information. Use simple sentences Make your average sentence 15 words long. Maximum length should be 25 words. Sentences with more than 40 words can be very difficult to understand. Avoid complex sentence structures with clauses, side notes or brackets. Choose short words Change long words to shorter synonyms. Avoid jargon Whether a word or phrase is jargon depends on your audience. Business jargon: Avoid phrases like “outside the box,” “core competencies,” “deliverables,” “blue sky thinking.” Legal jargon: Avoid terms like “aforementioned,” “herewith,” “herein.” Technical jargon: Avoid terms like “volatile memory,” “attribution model,” “flux capacitor.” Verbification: Avoid turning nouns into verbs unless they are commonly used as such (e.g., “securitized,” “dialogued,” “workshopping”). Acronyms: Limit your use of acronyms, especially internal ones (e.g., APC, EM, STMJ). If unavoidable, spell them out them on first use.  Structure and hierarchy Well-structured content improves readability and makes it easier for users to scan the page. It also improves search engine visibility, allows AI to accurately summarize and personalize the information, and serves users who are increasingly familiar with consuming content in bite-sized pieces. Important information first Use your page title, intro text and headings to give users the information they need, immediately. Generally, that means explaining what the product does first, then follow with details. Chunk your content The idea of chunking content is that you group similar content or concepts into clearly distinct blocks. This increases comprehension and help people scan a page. Some ways to chunk your content: Use visual elements in the page hierarchy such as headings, colors or dividers. Use plenty of white space. The minimum for paragraph breaks is usually 50 percent of the line spacing, or at least half the font size. Group similar content in tables and bulleted/numbered lists. Break down long text into paragraphs and long strings of text or numbers into smaller units. Enforce line breaks (50 to 70 characters in one line). The inverted pyramid style Find out the key information users need to complete a specific task or answer a question. Then give them just enough information to make decisions confidently, including the most relevant information at the top of the page or paragraph. This is also called front-loading. (Front-loading is great for giving users an easy way to understand your page and find something specific. But other types of pages, like storytelling or sequential instructions, don’t need an inverted pyramid.)  Source:  In an inverted pyramid, your text: captures attention quickly. By placing essential information at the top, you engage readers immediately. facilitates skimming. Users can quickly find what they are looking for without having to read through unnecessary details. improves usability. This format aligns with how people naturally read online — scanning for key points rather than reading every word. Clear and meaningful headings and subheadings Remember, web users are habitual scanners when they arrive at a page. So make scanning easy for them by using clear and meaningful headings and subheadings. These will let them quickly see what is on a page and if it has value for them. Clear headings are also vital for . General rules: Write headings to cover the main points of the page. Avoid vague one-word headings and subheadings. Use keywords the user is likely to be looking for. Use clear words. Use . Avoid using end punctuation except for question marks or when a heading is two or more sentences Organize headings and subheadings hierarchically: An H2 will sit under H1, an H3 under H2, and on down Limit your use of please and happy talk Happy talk is small talk in writing, such as welcoming your visitors on the page. While it may seem friendly, it often hinders effective communication and usability. Similarly, overusing "please" can clutter your message and slow down communication. Users appreciate websites that respect their time. When it’s okay to use please: In emails, which are a more personal communication. When we need them to perform a task like reviewing a manuscript, Please accept this transfer offer by… reads less abruptly than Accept this transfer offer by… Read your email copy after drafting it. Does the formality slow down the message? Maybe ask a colleague to read it. In error messages, which occur during moments of frustration. If we need the user to reload a page or perform a task again, it makes sense to be sympathetic in that moment, and say Please try again later or similar. Examples Content-in-content and SERP features  An example of a Featured Snippet in a Google SERP Content-in-content and SERP (search engine results page) features like featured snippets, “People also ask,” and knowledge panels help users find relevant information quickly. However, they can also lead to information overload. This is what you could do to help your users: Featured snippets: Answer common questions directly and concisely. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and clear headings to make it easy for search engines to extract and display your content. This helps users get the information they need without wading through lengthy texts. People also ask: Address related questions in your content. This can help a page appear in the “People also ask” boxes, increasing visibility. To avoid overwhelming users, group related questions together and provide clear, concise answers. Knowledge panels: Ensure the content is authoritative and well-cited. Knowledge panels often pull information from trusted sources, so building a site’s authority can help your content be featured. Use clear and straightforward language to make content easy to understand.  ---  ## Using and Writing for In-Product Messaging  Using and writing for In-product messaging In-product messaging (IPM) is a powerful channel to deliver messages directly to users. The messages can be very helpful but can also cause frustration and disrupt the experience when misused or mismanaged. When using IPM, keep the following characteristics in mind: Temporary solution: to help with an issue that can't be solved in the product directly or a notification for a limited time only. Highly tailored: IPM solutions such as Pendo can be highly tailored to speak to specific users at specific pages when a specific event occurs. Layer on top of the product: IPM is (mostly) not part of the product, but is coded or built on top of the product and can be managed from a different tool. Some users will not be able to see the IPM, so products should be able to function without them. Considerations Before introducing IPM to a product, ask the following questions: If users are not interacting with the feature, could this be a usability issue? If users are not understanding a specific feature, can this be solved by renaming or rewording its description instead of explaining it via IPM? Can this content be added to the product itself instead of a layer on top of the UI? Also, consider collaboration across teams and departments as someone else might have already solved a similar issue. Some best practices for collaboration are: Establish a diverse and inclusive team (e.g., product, marketing, engineering, design) responsible for implementation and evaluation of incoming requests for new guides. Keep track of the existing guides and frequently evaluate if they're still needed. Refer to  as an example. Adoption of Pendo Pendo is the preferred tool within Elsevier for IPM. With a broad range of targeting opportunities and monitoring metrics, Pendo allows the creator to only show a guide when relevant. It also monitors the guide's success. For more information, view the  or the . Writing for IPM Inconsistencies in copy, or too much copy, can be overwhelming and create confusion for the user. This causes them to exit the guide, and in the worst case, leave the product. To provide effective and consistent messages, use the set of Elsevier content guidelines as well as product specific tone of voice if available. Some rules of thumb when writing for IPM: Keep the messages brief and concise. IPMs should take away friction and save the user time. Motivate action. What actions should the user take? And what's in it for them? A good way to write action-oriented content is to start sentences, and call-to-actions, with verbs. Start a conversation. Read the copy out loud to hear what it sounds like. Is there a back and forth? It should sound like talking to a real person. To focus the writing, keep an end goal in mind. The most identified reasons to launch IPM are to convert/retain users, raise awareness about certain issues or features, or to improve ease of use. Below are some tips and suggestions for each of these reasons. Convert/retain Convert/retain focuses on connection and trust. To win the user over, make them the center of the conversation. Why is this information important to them? What will they get out of subscribing, downloading et cetera? If there's a task involved, try setting expectations (e.g., this will only take 1 min; it’s only two steps.) Draw the user's attention and create a connection by adding , , , or . View examples in . The approach can be tested using the A/B testing feature in Pendo.  Raise awareness Raising awareness focuses on providing guidance and/or sharing helpful information with the user, such as information about a feature that they've never used before. Help the user with context and scope, try to answer questions such as: What does this feature do? Which problems does it solve? Why is it useful? How will it improve their current work flow? Make sure not to patronize or over-explain. Improve ease of use Improving ease of use focuses on removing roadblocks. If the user is reading this guide, chances are they're trying to get something done. They might be in a hurry, feeling frustrated or confused. They just need a solution—a shortcut. To help them move forward, be concise, clear, and straight to the point. Only share the most relevant information. Avoid being funny or witty, this might cause more frustration. Consider illustrating the steps by using visual materials to guide the user more effectively. Design and implementation Guidelines on design of guides, customized templates and scrips are available in . What to measure Agreeing on metrics for success that work for all stakeholders can be a challenge. That is why involving everyone in the discussion is important. Examples of success metrics: Recommendations for trying to measure the success of IPM: Measure true engagement. What's being used, how often and by whom. Obtain qualitative feedback. Add context to the quantitative to better understand people. Balance customer types. Give a strong voice to less-vocal customers. Focus on direct metrics. Direct metrics such as logins and in-product behavior will be more actionable. Combined or derived metrics such as gained profits or averages are more useful on a longer term. Don't gather too much data. Too much data could easily get overwhelming when analyzing, leading to analysis paralysis. Focus on metrics that matter. Consider other sources that could affect user behavior. A recent change to the in-product experience can contribute to the success of the guide. Tracking and reviewing all recent product work, marketing campaigns, and guide data is essential to fully understanding a perceived success or failure. Reach out to the community. When coming up with success metrics, reach out to  ().
